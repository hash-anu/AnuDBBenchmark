# AnuDBBenchmark
This benchmark repository depends on [AnuDB](https://github.com/hash-anu/AnuDB). To run the benchmarks:

1) Clone and build the AnuDB repository.

2) Update the artifact path in the build.sh script to point to the correct AnuDB binary.

3) Run the benchmark script to evaluate AnuDB performance on your Linux platform.

A SQLite benchmark is also included in the setup, but it is currently commented out. The current benchmark results reflect only AnuDB performance.

For more details about the benchmarking, please refer to this blog: [Add blog link here].
