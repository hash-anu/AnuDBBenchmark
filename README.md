# üöÄ AnuDBBenchmark
This repository benchmarks the performance of [AnuDB](https://github.com/hash-anu/AnuDB), a custom storage engine designed for high-efficiency data operations, in comparison with SQLite3.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:This benchmark focuses on specific workloads (insert, query, update, delete, and parallel operations using JSON documents) executed on embedded hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi).It is not a general-purpose performance comparison.SQLite is a feature-rich, general-purpose SQL database optimized for reliability and transactional correctness across a wide range of use cases.AnuDB is a lightweight engine optimized for high-throughput workloads with a different design philosophy.Results may vary based on workload characteristics, hardware, and tuning parameters.

### üîç Performance Analysis

#### Insert Operations
- **SQLite3**: 1154.87 ops/s
- **AnuDB**: 296.068 ops/s
- SQLite3 is approximately 3.9x faster at inserts

#### Query Operations
- **SQLite3**: 27.8886 ops/s
- **AnuDB**: 34.3761 ops/s
- AnuDB is approximately 1.23x faster at queries

#### Update Operations
- **SQLite3**: 605.107 ops/s
- **AnuDB**: 291.104 ops/s
- SQLite3 is approximately 2.1x faster at updates

#### Delete Operations
- **SQLite3**: 1819.51 ops/s
- **AnuDB**: 342.185 ops/s
- SQLite3 is approximately 5.3x faster at deletes

#### Parallel Operations
- **SQLite3**: 2.99223 ops/s (2,500 operations)
- **AnuDB**: 6.99629 ops/s (10,000 operations)
- AnuDB processed 4x more operations and achieved approximately 2.34x higher ops/s

### üìà Summary
- **SQLite3** excels at basic CRUD operations, particularly inserts and deletes
- **AnuDB** performs better in queries and parallel operations
- The choice between these databases would depend on your specific workload patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone and Build AnuDB
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hash-anu/AnuDB.git
cd AnuDB/third_party/nanomq/
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd ../..
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
or
# Configure with ZSTD compression support
cmake -DZSTD_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/zstd/include -DZSTD_LIB_DIR=/path/to/zstd/lib ..
make
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone This Benchmark Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hash-anu/AnuDBBenchmark.git
cd AnuDBBenchmark
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Benchmark
Use the `build.sh` script to compile the benchmark. You can optionally specify the path to the AnuDB repository:
